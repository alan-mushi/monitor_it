monitor_it
==========

Very simple remote system monitor using python 3, jquery and Chart.js.
Monitor cpu, memory, system load, disks and network interfaces of multiple servers within your internet browser.

## Disclamer

This is my first javascript project so if you have a better/cleaner way to do things, tell me about it!

## How to use

Send the file in `server_side` onto your server, modify what you want and run it with python3.
To close the server simply hit Ctrl+c.

Open `client_side/index.html` with your favorite internet browser.

That's it!

## Requirements
The server must run with python 3.

The browser must be HTML5 compatible.

Code breeded with python3 3.4 and google-chrome 28.0.1500.71.
